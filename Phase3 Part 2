table view creation

CREATE VIEW ItemView
AS SELECT 
    i.iId,
    i.Iname as itemName,
    p.Amount as NoOfBoxes,
    i.Sprice AS 'itemprice',
    p.Amount* i.Sprice AS 'ItemRevenue',
    COUNT(DISTINCT p.cId) AS ItemCustomers
FROM item i 
INNER JOIN order_item s ON i.iId = s.iId
INNER JOIN orders p ON p.oId = s.oId
WHERE i.iId = s.iId
GROUP BY i.iId;

SELECT  iId,itemName,NoOfBoxes,CONCAT('$', FORMAT(itemprice, 2)) AS 'itemprice'
FROM `itemview`
Where itemprice >= 3 and NoOfBoxes >= 1
